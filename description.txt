The heavens are falling, and creatures from afar have their eye on the world of terraria.

-1 Meteor Biome

-2 Weapon sets

Note: *THIS MOD CONTAINS COPYRIGHTED MUSIC FROM THE KIRBY FRANCHISE*

As of late, Nintendo has been lax on copyright, but I just wanted to mention this just in case ^

Music will be replaced by original tracks eventually
